# Skill Creator

Create effective Claude Skills using progressive disclosure.

## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when you notice:

- **Repeating context** across conversations (schemas, patterns,
  rules)
- **Domain expertise** needed repeatedly (API integration, framework
  conventions)
- **Project-specific knowledge** Claude should know automatically

## Skill Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Core instructions + metadata
├── references/       # Detailed docs (loaded as needed)
├── scripts/          # Executable operations
└── assets/           # Templates, images, files
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills load in 3 levels:

1. **Metadata** (~27 tokens) - YAML frontmatter for triggering
2. **Instructions** (<680 tokens) - SKILL.md body with core patterns
3. **Resources** (unlimited) - references/ scripts/ assets/ loaded on
   demand

**Key**: Keep Levels 1 & 2 lean. Move details to Level 3.

## Quick Start

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/my-skill/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and body
3. Test in conversation
4. Add references/ as content grows
