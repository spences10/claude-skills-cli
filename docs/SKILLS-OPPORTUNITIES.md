## High-Impact Skill Opportunities

### 1. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Gap**: Only 2 skills (test-validator,
testing-skills-with-subagents), huge demand.

#### test-runner

```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description:
  Smart test execution based on changes. Runs relevant tests, analyzes
  failures, suggests fixes. Use when running tests or debugging test
  failures.
---

# Test Runner

Intelligently runs tests based on file changes, analyzes failures, and
provides actionable feedback.

## Core Workflow

1. **Detect changes**: Git diff or file paths
2. **Find relevant tests**: Map changes → test files
3. **Execute tests**: Framework detection (Jest, pytest, cargo test,
   etc.)
4. **Analyze failures**: Parse output, identify patterns
5. **Suggest fixes**: Based on error messages and code context

## Framework Support

- JavaScript: Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Cypress
- Python: pytest, unittest
- Rust: cargo test
- Go: go test
- Java: JUnit, TestNG

See
[references/framework-patterns.md](references/framework-patterns.md)
for test detection logic.
```

**Value**: Every project needs this. High reuse potential.

#### coverage-analyzer

```markdown
---
name: coverage-analyzer
description:
  Analyzes test coverage, identifies untested code paths, generates
  test stubs. Use when improving test coverage or adding tests for new
  features.
---
```

**Unique angle**: Not just showing coverage %, but generating test
stubs for uncovered branches.

#### snapshot-manager

```markdown
---
name: snapshot-manager
description:
  Manages snapshot tests (Jest, Insta), reviews changes, updates
  safely. Use when snapshot tests fail or need updating.
---
```

**Value**: Snapshot tests are common but poorly understood. Skill can
explain WHY snapshots changed.

### 2. Security & Compliance

**Gap**: Only 1 generic security skill, no specialized tools.

#### dependency-auditor

```markdown
---
name: dependency-auditor
description:
  Audits dependencies for vulnerabilities, suggests updates, validates
  licenses. Use when updating dependencies or security review needed.
---

# Dependency Auditor

Scans dependencies for security issues and license compliance.

## Capabilities

1. **Vulnerability scanning**: npm audit, cargo audit, pip-audit, etc.
2. **Update recommendations**: Safe upgrade paths with changelog
   review
3. **License compliance**: Check for license conflicts
4. **Supply chain**: Verify package integrity, detect typosquatting

## Detection

Automatically detects:

- package.json + package-lock.json → npm audit
- Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock → cargo audit
- requirements.txt / pyproject.toml → pip-audit
- go.mod → go list -m all + OSV database

See
[references/vulnerability-databases.md](references/vulnerability-databases.md)
```

**Differentiator**: Cross-language support, automated remediation
suggestions.

#### secrets-scanner

```markdown
---
name: secrets-scanner
description:
  Scans for hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials. Prevents commits
  with secrets. Use before commits or when security audit needed.
---
```

**Hook integration**: Perfect for PreToolUse/git commit hook.

#### security-reviewer

---
name: security-reviewer
description:
  Reviews code for security issues (injection, XSS, CSRF, auth bugs).
  Use when reviewing PRs or implementing authentication.
---
```

**Value**: Democratizes security expertise. OWASP Top 10 built-in.

### 3. Cross-Tool Orchestration

**Gap**: Tools exist in isolation, no orchestration patterns.

#### git-workflow-manager

```markdown
---
name: git-workflow-manager
description:
  Manages git workflows (feature branches, PR creation, merge
  strategies). Enforces commit conventions, generates changelogs. Use
  for git operations and PR workflows.
---

# Git Workflow Manager

Orchestrates git operations with best practices built-in.

## Workflows

1. **Feature branch**: Create → commit → push → PR
2. **Hotfix**: Branch from main → fix → PR with urgency labels
3. **Release**: Tag → changelog → GitHub release → merge to main

## Conventions

- Commit messages: Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Branch naming: feature/_, bugfix/_, hotfix/\*
- PR templates: Auto-generated based on changes

## Integration

Works with:

- GitHub CLI (gh)
- Changesets
- Conventional Changelog
- Semantic Release

See [references/git-patterns.md](references/git-patterns.md)
```

**Value**: Reduces git workflow cognitive load, enforces consistency.

#### package-manager-smart

```markdown
---
name: package-manager-smart
description:
  Intelligently manages dependencies across npm, pnpm, yarn, pip,
  cargo, go modules. Detects package manager, runs correct commands,
  handles workspaces.
---
```

**Unique**: Detects lock files and workspace configs, uses correct
package manager automatically.

#### ci-cd-helper

```markdown
---
name: ci-cd-helper
description:
  Creates and maintains CI/CD configs for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI,
  CircleCI. Adds test runs, linting, deployment. Use when setting up
  CI/CD or adding workflows.

## Bundled Skills Recommendations

For `claude-skills-cli`, consider bundling these high-utility,
general-purpose skills:

### Core Bundle (Should ship with CLI)

1. **skill-creator** ✅ Already included
2. **skill-validator** - Automated quality checking
3. **skill-tester** - Subagent-based behavioral testing
4. **skill-discovery** - Find and install skills from community

### Extended Bundle (Optional install)

5. **test-runner** - Universal test execution
6. **git-workflow-manager** - Git best practices
7. **dependency-auditor** - Security scanning
8. **claude-code-tutor** - Learn Claude Code features

### Rationale

- **Core bundle**: Essential for skill development lifecycle
- **Extended bundle**: High-utility, frequently needed across projects
- **Size**: Core ~20KB, Extended ~100KB (reasonable)

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Skills Marketplace

**Problem**: No central discovery mechanism for community skills.

**Solution**: Create skills registry with:

- Search/filter by domain, language, framework
- Quality ratings based on validation metrics
- Usage statistics (if opted-in)
- One-click installation via CLI

**Implementation**:

```bash
claude-skills-cli search "testing"
claude-skills-cli install test-runner
claude-skills-cli browse --domain security
```

### 2. Skill Testing Framework

**Problem**: No standard way to validate skill effectiveness.

**Solution**: Provide subagent testing harness:

```bash
claude-skills-cli test my-skill --scenarios test_cases.json
```

**Test format**:

```json
{
	"scenarios": [
		{
			"name": "Feature implementation happy path",
			"input": "Add a login button to the homepage",
			"expectedBehavior": [
				"Creates component file",
				"Adds tests",
				"Updates imports"
			],
			"pressure": ["time constraint", "unclear state management"]
		}
	]
}
```

### 3. Hook Library

**Problem**: Hook integration is underutilized due to lack of
examples.

**Solution**: Provide hook templates and common patterns:

```bash
claude-skills-cli add-hook --template pre-commit-checks
claude-skills-cli add-hook --template post-edit-validation
claude-skills-cli add-hook --template resource-tracking
```

### 4. Skill Analytics

**Problem**: No visibility into skill effectiveness or usage.

**Solution**: Optional analytics collection:

- Which skills are triggered most often
- Average tokens per skill trigger
- User satisfaction (thumbs up/down)
- A/B testing different skill versions

**Privacy**: Opt-in, local-first, aggregated only.

### 5. AI-Assisted Skill Improvement

**Problem**: Skills become stale or drift from best practices.

**Solution**: Automated skill maintenance:

```bash
claude-skills-cli audit my-skill --suggest-improvements
```

**Suggestions**:

- "Description could include trigger keywords: testing, coverage, QA"
- "SKILL.md is 243 lines, consider moving examples to references/"
- "Script missing error handling for missing dependencies"
- "Similar to community skill 'test-runner' - consider alignment"
